Configuring Atarashii! for Development and Building


Fetching the Code
-----------------
After cloning the Atarashii code, you will need to fetch the third-party
code stored as submodules. In the root Atarashii directory, run the
following two commands:

  - git submodule init
  - git submodule update
 
This will fetch the required third-party libraries used in the code.

If you will be working with the submodule code directly, please read about
maintaining submodules at
http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Tools-Submodules


Importing the Projects to Eclipse with the ADT Plugin
-----------------------------------------------------
You should already have the ADT Plugin installed. If you do not, follow the
instructions at https://developer.android.com/tools/sdk/eclipse-adt.html

NOTE: Due to naming conflicts, you will need to import each project individually.

First, import the main Atarashii project:

  - In Eclipse, create a new "Android Project from Existing Code"
  - Select the Atarashii checkout root folder
  - Deselect all items and only select the Atarashii main project, which should
    be listed at the top
  - You may rename this project from the default name given by Eclipse

Next, import each of the third-party modules. Currently, these are only
ActionBarSherlock and android-numberpicker. For each project, follow these
steps:

  - In Eclipse, create a new "Android Project from Existing Code"
  - Select the library folder for each library
  - You should only see one project, named "library"
  - You *must* rename this project from the default name given by Eclipse. It
    is recommended to use the name of the library for ease of reference.


Linking Atarashii and the Libraries
-----------------------------------
View the project properties for the Atarashii project in Eclipse. Select the
"Java Build Path" node in the tree. From the Projects tab, add the library
projects. On the library tab, select "Add JARs..." and add the jar files found
in the libs directory.

You should now be able to successfully build and develop Atarashii!
